## Screenshots/Videos
<!-- If applicable, add screenshots or videos to help explain your changes -->

## Database Changes

## Security Considerations
<!-- Address any security implications -->
- [ ] **Database**: Used SQLAlchemy ORM (no raw SQL)
- [ ] **API**: Input validation with Pydantic models

- [ ] **Secrets**: No API keys or credentials in code
- [ ] **Logging**: No sensitive data (tokens, passwords) in logs

## Performance Considerations
**If applicable to your changes:**
- [ ] **Database**: Queries use appropriate indexes and filters
- [ ] **API**: Endpoints don't fetch unnecessary data
- [ ] **Frontend**: No large unnecessary dependencies bundled
- [ ] **LlamaStack**: Calls are efficient (correct endpoints used, not called in loops, etc.)
- [ ] **File operations**: Handled appropriately (size limits, chunked processing, cleanup, background tasks)

## Breaking Change Impact

### otherwise:
- [ ] Migration guide provided for existing users
- [ ] Deprecation notices added where appropriate
- [ ] Rollback strategy documented
